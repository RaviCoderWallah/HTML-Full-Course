    <h1> My Projects </h1>

    <h2>QRCodeGenerator</h2>
    <p> QRCodeGenerator FlashNews is a modern, responsive QRCode website built to deliver breaking news and articles in
        real-time.

        <br> <br>

        It mimics professional media platforms in layout and functionality.

        FlashNews features a grid-based design with categories like World, Technology, Health, and Entertainment.

        Built with clean HTML and CSS and enhanced by JavaScript, FlashNews allows users to scroll through dynamically
        updated headlines, explore detailed articles, and even bookmark favorite reads.

        The Figma-based design was crucial in planning a readable, clutter-free experience.

    <h2>GameVerse</h2>
    <p>## About GameVerse GameVerse is an interactive gaming platform that unifies all types of games into one sleek,
        responsive website.

        Designed with the modern gamer in mind, GameVerse offers a streamlined interface where users can explore
        trending games, filter by genre, and view immersive game trailers.

        The project combines strong UI/UX principles using Figma prototypes and translates them into a pixel-perfect
        implementation with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

        With responsive animations, real-time updates, and theme toggling, the experience feels native across devices.

        The homepage showcases a carousel of trending games and categories.

        Each game page includes a detailed description, rating, trailer, and launch button. <br> <br>

        The UI is designed with accessibility in mind, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes and
        navigate with keyboard shortcuts.

        JavaScript handles game sorting, filtering, and interactive content display.

        This project is a creative expression of what a centralized, accessible hub for digital games can look like in a
        browser environment.

        This project demonstrates how thoughtful design and clean code can create a dynamic user-centric gaming portal.
